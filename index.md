# Hello & Welcome!!
Welcome to my silly little GitHub landing page. Here you will find lots of small and silly examples of code. I have also put in a few 
examples of the classic design patterns with a few classic coding questions & answers. Many of these examples are, lets face it, overly 
simplistic. I have never had to solve fizz buzz for a client, but people seen to like that sort of thing, so it is in there. Anyone who 
pays me to code for them wants me to keep their code confidential, so the examples of code here are just a hodge podge of things that I 
wrote that I thought would be fun, and that I thought would be of interest to someone who wants to see some code examples. If you have 
come this far, just click on the button above and that will take you to my repository. There you will find a ton of C# code, ASP.Net: Web 
forms and Core, Might even be some HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery, who knows?  Please let me reiterate. These are just simple coding 
examples. Just to let you get a feel for me.


### Some quick notes about me. 
*I work well with clients, teams, or one on one.  
*I live in the Microsoft world, with a bit of Linux thrown in.
*I try to make non technical people feel great about their experiences with coders.  
*I am always learning, experimenting, and trying new things. I keep redoing things in my repositories. They are for play.
 
Oh, and one small sour note. I do this for money. Not for exposure, not for X% of the profit of your great idea. I have every confidence 
that your project will make you very rich, but I donâ€™t work on a percentage. Sorry about that. Not trying to be rude, I just get hit up 
for free work all the time, and this seems like the most graceful way to save us both some embarrassment. 
Thanks!
Mike
