# Hello & Welcome!!  
My name is Michael Pories. I am a mid level full stack software developer.
Some fun things about me!

I have a life long commitment to learning, and never stop in my quest to keep on top of both new technologies and new techniques in current technologies.

I enjoy talking to both technical and non technical people about technical issues. Due to that I have extensive client facing experience. I make people feel at home in an environment that is difficult, and both time consuming and scary for them. 

I have a broad range of exposure to various forms of information systems technologies, and in-depth knowledge of a variety of software languages and frameworks including but not limited to C#, JavaScript, Node.js, JQuery, Python, HTML(5), CSS(3), Bootstrap, SQL (Sequel), T-SQL (Tansact-SQL), LINQ (Language Integrated Query), Entity, ASP.Net Framework/Core, ASP.Net MVC, ASP.Net WebForms, WPF, WinForms, REST, SOAP, JSON, APIs, XML. 

I work well in an agile environment, and I am most comfortable with GitHub as my version control system, but am happy to work in any version control system. I have a strong understanding of the GOF design principles and their implementations, OOP, and a commitment to SOLID design principles.

I spend most of my time programming in the following ways: new features, touch ups, optimization changes, and bug fixes.  That doesn’t mean that I haven’t worked in a green field, but I have done more work fixing code than anything else.

In your advertisement you said you wanted the following things that I have extensive experience with: Clean, efficient, reusable, and reliable C# code with great performance, quality and responsiveness.
